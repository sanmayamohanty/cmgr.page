# Harnessing The Desire for Exclusivity

None of us are new to the idea of **hype and exclusivity** around product launches.

N26, Dropbox ran some of the most viral product launch campaigns by harnessing the desire for exclusivity.

**It has some psychological ground, too**: according to Rene Girard’s mimetic theory, we tend to want things simply because other people want them. 

Human desire is not an autonomous process but a collective one — this is how we decide what we care about. On top of this, life inside the velvet rope is, well, pretty good. 

There’s a real, psychological fulfilment of being “in” with the crowd and stoking envy among those around you. 

## How do you leverage the desire for exclusivity?

Here are some actionable insights for leveraging the desire for exclusivity.

* Giving community **exclusive benefits.**
* Providing them **Swags**.



* **Building in Public:**

  * Propose **interesting product ideas** and ask the community for feedback.
  * Post **screenshots** of internal Slack messages showcasing company culture.
  * Tell **emotional stories** about your company to pull at followers’ heartstrings

* **Create designated Inner and Outer Rings**.
  * A **larger outer ring** is important as it creates **FOMO**, so more outsiders can evaluate a community before seeking membership. 
  * It’s important to have an **inner ring** too as this gives shared values explorers something to aspire to and provides that important safe space for your members.
  * If you prefer welcoming visitors to all community activities, an inner ring can be designated by privileges. This means members are allowed to do things that visitors are not.
