# Introduction

**Welcome to the  CMGR Guide! This is a community initiative managed by Sanmaya Mohanty that contains the resources that Community Professionals will need in their journey of building communities and nurturing relationships.** 

This guide is aimed at being the single stop solution for everything that a community professional might need in his journey of learning. This is also aimed towards people who want to start a career in community management and want to learn all the ins and outs of community management. 

This guide is an effort to assimilate a lot of lessons that community professionals around the world have learned from building and engaging communities -- all in a single CMGR Playbook.

**Disclaimer:** This is a living guide and is therefore never finished. It's an ongoing project that we are always trying to update and improve as we and the global community of CMGR professionals learn and evolve. Try everything, contribute your learnings back to this guide, or suggest topics that we should cover by reaching out to us.



```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
