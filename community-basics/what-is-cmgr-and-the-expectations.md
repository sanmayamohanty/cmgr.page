## What is not Community Management?

As someone who is beginning their journey into getting to know what community management is, it's pretty natural to get overwhelmed by the uncanny resemblance the domain has with other domains such as marketing or social media management, and not being able to spot the distinction.

While at times there could be some overlap between all these different domains, let me assure you **community management is not social media management, it is also not online customer support.** 

These are just some of the tools and skillsets that a community manager is expected to and should hold in his arsenal.
