# CMGR Lingo

Before diving further into the world of community management, it is better to make yourself familiar with the major terminologies used in the community industry.

You can always come back to this module, whenever you need to find the meaning of a term.

## Common Terms

**CMGR**: This acronym refers to a community manager or a community professional. Often known as \#CMGR.



**NPS**: Net Promoter Score. It is a metric used in customer experience programs. NPS measures the loyalty of customers to a company. NPS scores are measured with a single question survey and reported with a number from -100 to +100, a higher score is desirable.



**CES**: Customer Effort Score is a type of **customer** satisfaction survey used to measure the ease of service experience with an organization. It asks **customers** to rate the ease of using products or services on a scale of “very difficult” or “very easy.”



**90:9:1 Rule:** This is the rule for participation inequality in Social Media and Online Communities. In most online communities, 90% of the users are lurkers who never contribute, 9% of the users contribute little bit, and 1% of users account for almost all the action that happens in the community.



**AMA:** It stands for Ask Me Anything. These are community engagement programs that community professionals often employ to facilitate Question and Answer \(QnA\) exchanges between members and Subject Matter Experts \(SMEs\). They provide a great medium to ensure transparency, accessibility, and knowledge sharing.



**Ambassador**: It refers to a member who participates in formal leadership programs inside a community. Often these programs are called "Advocacy Programs".



**CRM**: Customer Relationship Management. It is often an online tool that is used to manage the company's interaction with current and future customers. 



**Gamification**: Gamification is the skill of understanding what game-based motivators may drive members and how to use those motivators to help members get value out of the community that they may not initially recognize. Often times gamification efforts appear in the form of points, badges, or 'games' that encourage gentle competition around engagement.



**Lurker**: A member who only views content.



**Moderator**: A person who moderates an Internet forum or online discussions. Sometimes the Community Manager fulfills this role. 



**On-Boarding:** The process of bringing a new member up to speed in the community space.

 

**ROI**: Return on Investment.
