# What is Community?

As it goes without saying, before getting into how to manage a community we have to first understand, what is the meaning of the word community.  \(literally! and in the business sense as well!\)

{% hint style="info" %}
A community is a group of people who display shared goals and shared struggles. It provides people with a sense of belonging and a network of like-minded individuals they can connect with based on their shared characteristics.
{% endhint %}



Now that we have a broad idea of what a community refers to.

Its' time to clear some air about community management in the next chapter, where we decode the term CMGR.
