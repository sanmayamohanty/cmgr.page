# \[WIP\] Converting Newcomers to Active Members

{% embed url="https://www.feverbee.com/how-to-convert-newcomers-into-regular-members/" %}

_**1\) The newcomers**. These are the members that have joined the community within the previous 30 days._

_You need to socialize these members into the community without overwhelming them. You can use autoresponders for this. Begin with a simple message that directs newcomers to a topical discussion that’s taking place \(you need to update this weekly\), then a few days later \(if they clicked the link\) send them either a small nudge for their opinion again or highlight an upcoming event/activity they can participate in._

_There isn’t one single best journey. You need to tweak these until you optimize the process. The more members visit and participate, the more frequently you can send them information that explains a little more about the community or highlights things they can do. Remember, that these are newcomers, your e-mails should be designed to reduce their social fear of participating and provide simple steps they can take to participate._

_The general process here lasts up to 3 months and is responsive to their actions in the community. If they don’t respond to the first few e-mails, send one per month for 3 months. If they are responding, you can send more._

_We typically find it best to begin with 1 e-mail, wait a few days, then another, wait a week then another. But, again, this varies wildly per community and the actions each individual takes. You can set up multiple routes based upon clicks/opens/actions. If in doubt get an e-mail marketing expert to help \(or_ [_hire us_](https://www.feverbee.com/Consultancy.html) _to set it up for you\)._

_**2\) The lurkers**. These are registered members that have visited, but not made a contribution, within the previous 30 days. There is_ [_little chance_](https://www.feverbee.com/2012/12/de-lurking.html) _that a large number of these members will become regular active members._

_However, you can provide regular content which highlights things they can read in the community with clear links to share it on social media channels which can bring more people to the community. Specifically, highlight the most useful advice or most entertaining stories/experiences shared in the community, This is what lurkers are most likely to share on social media platforms._

_**3\) The registered, inactive, members**. These are the members which have registered for the community but not visited in the previous 30 days. They are not lurkers. It may be possible to bring these members back into the community. In this group you need to highlight activities within the community which they can participate in._

_The open and click-through rates for this group will be very low. Don’t panic about that, nor the unsubscribe rate. These are essentially members you’ve already lost. Any return from this group is a bonus._

_We usually use the biggest/most exciting activity/discussion in the community per month to bring these members back. It has to be something truly remarkable. If they click the link, then we use follow up autoresponders with other discussions scheduled a few days later that are related to the first activity._
