# Business Need Identification

## What is the Business Objective that you are trying to accomplish through this community? 

It could be anything, but generally, it is one of the following 

* Increasing Sales
* Increasing Brand Awareness
* Decreasing the cost of customer service
* Co-creation of new products
* Establishing your brand as a thought leader
* Educating customers
* Enabling customers and community members to collaborate and share knowledge.

Also, this does not stop here. If your business is new to leveraging community, then it might require effort from your end to convince the c-suite and ensure executive buy-in.
