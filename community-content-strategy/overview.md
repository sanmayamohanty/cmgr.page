2. Art of compelling storytelling

Storytelling is a powerful way to make a point. Community managers are excellent storytellers because of the visibility they have with customers. Community managers have no shortage of content ideas to draw from considering their role. While topics matter, style and delivery are equally important. Good storytelling doesn't always mean lengthy. Some of the best storytelling is very succinct. Look at Seth Godin's blog. He keeps it very brief. A large part of this is how you say whatever it is you're trying to convey. When you think of customer support messaging you don't think of inspired and meaningful content. Now we're seeing a resurgence of simple and image-based storytelling. Stick figures are back. Considering that humans actually learn best via storytelling and visual imagery, customers are flocking to companies that have learned how to trim the complication. There are a lot of ways to make the community members shine through impactful storytelling. Community managers can leverage their knowledge about specific super users in the community to educate others as well as reward and recognize a loyal superuser.

**3. An example of a good support community content strategy.**

The community's content should be organized in a way that’s easy for the user to navigate. From a support perspective [Apple](https://www.forbes.com/companies/apple/) does a beautiful job of organizing their communities content. The user experience is clean and easy to navigate. In the community at the top of each article Apple tells you exactly what you will learn after reading that article. At the end of the article the user can easily start a community thread about the article. This is a company that values its customers time.

As far as content curation in general less is more. Smaller amounts of purposeful content is preferable to mass amounts of uncategorized content. Everyone needs to slow down and think about what they're doing for a minute. Many communities could use a lift from an infrastructure perspective. You can serve up the most compelling stories but if the user experience isn’t good, forget about it. Content strategy plays a role in the omni-channel experience. It all comes back to brand consistency in all your content, regardless of channel.
