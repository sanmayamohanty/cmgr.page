# Motivation behind the Guide

At the time when I was looking for guidance or specific information while navigating my role as a community professional, I always stumbled upon one difficulty. 

The answer to any specific query is available but you have to search very hard. And most of the time the exact piece of advice that you are looking for is buried within the transcript of a podcast.

So I have tried to create a single repository for all things related to community building. All tagged according to their individual categories.

As this repository grows, we will have a **curated list of community resources** all segmented into requisite groups. The entire repository is searchable and anyone can find the best practices related to a specific field in no time, skim through the notes and decide on what steps to take further. 

During the course of writing this guide, I have listened to **40+ podcasts, 100+ articles, and 3 whitepapers** on community building.
