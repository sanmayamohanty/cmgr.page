# Why communities are necessary for businesses?

**Simple answer,** so that the different stakeholders of the business \(customers, employees etc.\) dont feel a disconnect to others and the companies they do business with. 

When businesses invest in community management, they transition from a normal brand to a more human brand — one that takes care of the needs of the people who support them, work for them, and interact with them.

**Some obvious benefits to Businesses from Community Engagement:**

* Enthusiastic members help acquire new members, resulting in lower customer acquisition costs and a tight viral loop.
* Members are less likely to abandon the community, resulting in increased retention and therefore improved lifetime value.
* Members support one another, resulting in high ROI from community due to a lower cost of service.

Community efforts give way for very real network effects: as the engagement grows, the community gets smarter, faster to respond, more globally available, and generates more value.
